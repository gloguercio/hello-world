My first training repository into learning GitHub

Hello stranger!

Right now I'm learning how to use branches, a cool feature on GitHub and it works like a paralel timeline. You create a copy of your code at that time, and start to edit it without changing the original version. How neat, right?

Once you save a chage, it's called commit, wich has a associated message, explaining why the edit was needed. This way everyone can understand the development of the code.
